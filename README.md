# Sales Analysis Case Study

## Introduction:
A generic, simulated dataset which indicates the daily trading information for a large retail store has been provided. The data is only for one of the products sold at the store. 

## Objective:
To develop metrics and derive subsequent insights.
The metrics include;
- The sales price per unit
- The average unit sales price of the product
- The daily % gross profit
- The Price Elasticity of Demand during one of the promotional/special periods

## Tools used
Databricks (Python)
- Pandas - Data loading, cleaning and analysis
- Numpy - Mathematical operations
- Matplotlib - Visualisation library
- Plotly - For ploting graphs

## Dataset
File: Sales Case Study.csv

The dataset shows the daily trading information for the store, aggregated for the day. The goal is to derive insightful metrics.

- Date - The day on which sales occured
- Sales - Total rand value of the sale that occured
- Cost Of Sales - The total rand value of the cost of sale that occured
- Quantity Sold	- Total number of units that hve been sold

## Metrics derived
- Daily sales price per unit
- Average unit sales price of this product
- Daily % gross profit
- Price Elasticity of Demand

## Visualisation
A graph showing sales over time was plotted using Matplotlib and Plotly

## Presenation
A presentation with all the metrics derived and interpretations was made.
